Congratulations on the launch! Moving from a functional prototype to a public-facing repository is the final step in establishing that "AI Architect" authority. A great README doesn't just explain *what* the code does; it explains the **Technical Logic** and the **Value Proposition**.

Since we are positioning this as an **Agentic Content Engine**, the README needs to look like a professional internal tool.

# 🛰️ Agentic Content Engine (v1)
### Transforming Technical Articles into Multi-Day Social Campaigns with Gemini 3.1 Pro

The **Agentic Content Engine** is a semi-autonomous internal tool designed for technical writers and developers. It slashes the "distribution tax" by ingesting long-form content (via dev.to API) and architecting a structured, 3-day social media blitz across X, LinkedIn, and Discord.

## 🚀 The "4-Hour" Workflow Slash
Traditionally, re-formatting a technical deep-dive for three different platforms takes hours of manual context-switching. This tool automates the **Reasoning Tier**, providing platform-specific hooks and deep-dives while keeping the human in the loop for the final deployment.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The system is built on a **Three-Tier Agentic Workflow**:

1. **Ingestion Layer:** Connects to the Forem API to fetch raw Markdown, ensuring the AI has the full technical context of the original research.
2. **Reasoning Layer (Gemini 3.1 Pro):** Uses high-level reasoning to perform "Thematic Decomposition." It maps the article into:
   - **Day 1 (The Hook):** High-engagement X threads.
   - **Day 2 (The Deep-Dive):** Professional LinkedIn insights.
   - **Day 3 (The Lessons):** Community-focused Discord updates.
3. **Execution Layer:** A React-based Kanban board with a server-side pipeline to Discord Webhooks for one-click deployment.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Truncation:** Automatic 250-character capping for social cards to ensure scannability.
- **Strict Schema Enforcement:** Robust JSON sanitization to prevent LLM "chatty" hallucinations from breaking the UI.
- **Kanban Strategy Board:** A platform-first view of your distribution timeline.
- **One-Click Discord Deploy:** Direct integration with Discord Webhooks.
